JT5205 is an ADPCM sound source written in Verilog, fully compatible with OKI MSM5205.

## Port Description

Name     | Direction | Width | Purpose
---------|-----------|-------|--------------------------------------
rst      | input     |       | active-high asynchronous reset signal
clk      | input     |       | clock
cen      | input     |       | clock enable.
sel      | input     | 2     | selects the data rate
din      | input     | 4     | input data
sound    | output    | 12    | signed sound output

## Usage

This is a pin-to-pin compatible module with OKI MSM5205. If you are just going to use it on a retro core you don't need to know the internals of it just hook it up and be sure that the effective clock rate, i.e. clk&cen signal, is the intended 384kHz (or whatever your system needs).

If you hear a periodic noise when there should be no output, check whether your target system was leaving the MSM5205 halted at reset when no output was needed. If The part is not reset it will keep processing the output and a constant 0 input will produce a repetitive noise.
